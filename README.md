Time-honored tradition repository following Hello World guide

I really have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to GitHub or "coding" in general, but it has always fascinated me.
I'd love to learn how to do more of this so that I can translate the learned skills into new abilities at work for my primary job role as a Sys Admin/Sys Engineer at a MSP, with a focus on our "Cloud Services", utilizing tools such as LabTech and ConnectWise.
